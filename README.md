# Terraform CI/CD Demo AWS 

This repository demonstrates using Github Actions to create a CI/CD pipeline that deploys Terraform infrastructure to AWS.

## Preparing AWS to run the example

1. You will need an AWS account. Log into it using the AWS Console. 

1. Create an S3 bucket. It will be used for the Terraform backend state file. Note the bucket name as you will use it in your Terraform configuration. 

1. In IAM, create a user account with Admin priviliges. Go to Security Credentials tab, and click the __Create access key__ button. Save the resulting Access and Secret Access keys to a text file. You will need them later. 


## Preparing the GitHub Repo

1. Log onto your GitHub account.  

1. Navigate to the following repository and fork it into your account: https://github.com/drehnstrom/terraform-cicd-demo-gcp 

1. Click on the __Actions__ menu. Then, click the __I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them__ button. 

1. In your new repository, click on __Settings__, then __Secrets | Actions__.

1. Create two repository secrets: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Set the values of these secrets to the coresponding keys you just created.  

1. Once the secrets are created, navigate to the file `space-invaders/provider.tf` in your GitHub repository. 

1. In the `backend` configuration, change the `bucket` value to the name of the bucket you created earlier. Also, make sure the region is set to the region you are using.

1. Now open the `space-invaders/terraform.tfvars` file and make sure the `region` variable is set to the one you are using. 

## Examing the CI/CD pipeline code file

1. Open the `.github/workflows/terraform.yaml` file.

1. Have a look at the code. The pipeline runs whenever there is a push or pull request. The __Checkout__, __Setup Terraform__, and __Terraform Init__ steps always run. The __Terraform Plan__ step only runs when there is a pull request. The __Terraform Apply__ step only runs when there is a push to the main branch. 


## Running the Pipeline

1. Create a new branch called `dev` and switch to it. 

1. From the Github website open the `space-invaders/terraform.tfvars` file. Click the edit button and change the value of `instance_count` from `0` to `1`. Commit the change. 

1. Click on the __Actions__ link. You should see your pipeline running. Click on it and you can see the detail. 

1. Now create a pull request to merge the dev branch into main. Once the pull request is created, again click the __Actions__ link. You should see the pipeline running again. Investigate the output of the __Terraform Plan__ step. 

1. Nothing has been created thus far because the __Terraform Apply__ step only runs on a push to main. Click one the __Pull requests__ menu and approve the merge. 

1. Again, click on the __Actions__ link and you should see the pipeline running. 

1. Go to your Google Cloud project. In __Compute Engine__ you should see a new virtual machine was created. In __VPC | Firewall__ you should see a new firewall rule was created. 


## Cleaning up the resources

1. Repeat the steps in the prior section, but change the `instance_count` variable in the `space-invaders/terraform.tfvars` file back to `0`. Make sure you make the edits on the dev branch. Commit the change, then make a pull request, and finally approve the pull request. 

1. Go to your Google Cloud project and verify that the Compute Engine virtual machine and the firewall rule have been deleted.
